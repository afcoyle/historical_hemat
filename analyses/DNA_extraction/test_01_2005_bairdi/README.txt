Test 01: 2005 Bairdi

This DNA extraction was performed on 4 randomly-selected C. bairdi from 2005.

Infection status was unknown - this is purely a test on the feasibility of extracting quality DNA
from these archived samples.

2005 was chosen as it was the earliest year available. Samples consist of hemolymph preserved in ethanol

Of the 4 samples chosen, one was discarded as it failed to pellet. Therefore, remaining samples are Samples 1, 2, and 4.

Samples were extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit. Samples were initially pelleted, and then treated as tissue samples.
Standard protocol was followed for the Qiagen kit, except in the elution step, where only 50 uL (rather than the standard 200) was used,
as previous conversations indicated this was optimal for maximizing DNA concentration in Tanner crab samples.

Extraction success was analyzed using Qubit and BioAnalyzer. 

Within the Qubit, 2 uL of extracted DNA was used.

Electropherogram.png, Gel.png, and .XAD file were all produced by the BioAnalyzer. Electropherogram and gel are screenshots of relevant windows in the .XAD file, as 
you need a specific program to open the .XAD file.
